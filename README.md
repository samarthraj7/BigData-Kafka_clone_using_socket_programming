# BigData-Kafka_clone_using_socket_programming

Repo created programmatically. Project Title: Yet another Kafka (YaK)

Yet Another Kafka Built using Python Programming Language. We used Socket Programming. Multiple producers to same topic. 
Multi-threading is used. In previous versions serial produce and consume is used.
If a file crosses a certain threshold, then a new partition is created. Logging is done for each Broker.

In the files , create a new folder to store the logs which are created due to the working of the consumers and texts you get from the topics produced.
And mark the location and get that location into the files wherever the location of the directory is mentioned
